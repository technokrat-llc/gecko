## The Swiss Rectifier (July 5, 2012)

In this newsletter, we present a new rectifier converter topology, the Swiss Rectifier. What was the motivation for the new topology? The easiest approach to three-phase mains rectification is a simple diode bridge. However, a diode bridge has a low power factor and introduces unwanted low frequency current harmonics into the grid. Additionally, many applications require a controlled output voltage. Therefore, Power Factor Correction (PFC) rectifiers are typically used, e.g. a 3-phase six-switch buck-type PFC rectifier. The new Swiss Rectifier employs active third harmonic current injection and allows to achieve efficiencies superior to that of conventional buck-type systems.
