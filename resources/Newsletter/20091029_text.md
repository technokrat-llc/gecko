# Oct. 29, 2009 - Text and Comments in the Worksheet
One missing feature is now available in GeckoCIRCUITS: It is the ability to write text comments directly into the worksheet. Have a look at the sreenshot and/or GeckoCIRCUITS online version below.
If you open GeckoCIRCUITS, the default example is the PMSM control with comments. Select File >> Open >> dq_control_pmsm.ipes to compare with the old (not commented) example. You find the new TextField in the Special-Tab. Some things like copying or color selection need improvement, but that will be done soon. You can change the look of the worksheet with the new View >> UseAntialiasing menu option.
We urgently needed text comments in the worksheet for the power electronics master course student exercise of the ETH Zurich, Switzerland. If you want to know what kind of examples the students have to work on, visit the webpage where the examples of the current course are listed, see the links C1 .. C5 (in German). Another five examples will be posted before end of the semester.

If you are interested in education, you can find the examples at the PES-homepage. Currently it's all in German.
In the master course student exercises we started to employ GeckoCIRCUITS in form of online-examples, and we are currently testing this approach. Up to now the students' feedback is very good. Students can experiment with the simulation at home which gives them a lot of flexibility. And the administration is very, very easy, especially considering the large number of students in the course.
