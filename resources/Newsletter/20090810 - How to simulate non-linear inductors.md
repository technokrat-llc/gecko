# Aug. 10, 2009 - How to simulate non-linear inductors
In two recent PhD projects at the Power Electronic Systems Lab., ETH Zurich, it became necessary to model non-linear capacitors and inductors. We spent the last week to implement such non-linear models into GeckoCIRCUITS. The first feedback was very good, and now you can test it online, too.
Just open the online-simulator (yellow box). A very simple example with two parallel inductors will open as default-example.

The week before we modeled basic thyristor circuits in [iPES](http://www.ipes.ethz.ch/ipes/), an educational website about power electronics. Probably you have already visited iPES and maybe you are using it from time to time (it's currently available in 12 different languages and has 9,000 visits per month).
Have a look at it at the [content page](http://www.ipes.ethz.ch/ipes/e_index.html), and follow one of the blue links 'Simulate Online'. Feel free to tell us what you think.
