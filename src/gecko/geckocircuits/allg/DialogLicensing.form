Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,&#xa;      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be&#xa;      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a&#xa;      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,&#xa;      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor&#xa;      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&#xa;&#xa;   9.
